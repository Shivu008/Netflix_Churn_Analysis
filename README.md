 📊 Netflix Churn & Retention Analysis
A complete end-to-end data analytics project solving Netflix’s real-world problem of early user churn using Excel, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and Power BI.

🚩 Problem Statement
Netflix was experiencing a decline in user retention, especially users canceling within the first month. As a business analyst, my objective was to analyze:
- What types of users are more likely to churn?
- Which content genres drive longer engagement?
- How subscription type, device, and region impact retention?

🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Excel: Data cleaning, formatting
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard with 4 analytical pages

📁 Project Structure
- dataset/Netflix_Analytics_100k.xlsx | Raw dataset used for the project 
- notebook/Netflix_Analysis.ipynb | Python code for EDA and insights 
- dashboard/Netflix_Analytics_100k.pbix | Power BI file with visual dashboard 
- dashboard/dashboard_screenshots/ | PNGs of each dashboard tab 

📊 Dashboard Pages
1. Overall – KPIs: Churn %, Avg. Watch Hours, Device Split
2. Subscription – Subscription-wise churn, Genre preference
3. Retention – Churn rate by quarter and region
4. Ratings – Genre-wise ratings & watch time by user sentiment

📌 Key Insights
- Standard Plan users had the highest churn rate
- Documentary & Thriller genres helped retain users
- Mobile and Smart TV users had better engagement than tablet/laptop users
- Region Area 23 had a disproportionately high churn rate

📈 Outcome
- Developed business-focused insights and visuals to improve retention
- Unified work across 3 tools (Excel, Python, Power BI)
